                    <p>
                        You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or shorton
                        time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The best way to
                        reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350
                        degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly

                        Thaw the frozen lasagna in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the reheating

                        from frozen — just make sure to add a few minutes to the cook time to ensure 
                        the dish is heated through.
